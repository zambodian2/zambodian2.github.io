      <description>Manga is generally structured a lot differently from Books because it&amp;rsquo;s serialized weekly. In the case of Shounen Jump, manga has to continuously meet popularity standards or else the story will be dropped. This means many long running manga have to split their story lines into digestible arcs to attract new readers and to keep the story fresh. It also leads to many manga using popular tropes and fan-service to keep reader&amp;rsquo;s weekly interest.</description>
