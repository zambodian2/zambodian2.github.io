In the case of Shounen Jump, manga has to continuously meet popularity standards or else the story will be dropped. This means many long running manga have to split their story lines into digestible arcs to attract new readers and to keep the story fresh. It also leads to many manga using popular tropes and fan-service to keep reader&rsquo;s weekly interest. This has led to several manga with little creative freedom; Authors will borrow popular character and story archetypes because they know the formula is safe. Many manga end far too quickly or are drawn out longer than needed at the request of the editors. At the same time however, the medium of comics/manga give authors the potential for kinds of creativity that doesnâ€™t exist anywhere else. What sets One Piece apart is that Oda is capable of utilizing all of manga&rsquo;s creative strengths into a story that perfectly fulfills a serialized structure. Oda&rsquo;s world is built for adventure as the straw hat&rsquo;s must face new challenges as they progress through the grand line one island at a time. Each island has it&rsquo;s own unique environment, culture, and enemy so the story doesn&rsquo;t feel dry. In the beginning, many of these stories seem encapsulated. However, as you progress, long time readers are rewarded with reoccurring characters and payoffs to mysteries set up several hundred chapters before. Despite the complex world building, new generations of readers are easily enticed by Oda&rsquo;s characters, themes, and plot lines that are simple to understand, yet powerfully executed. In what was supposed to be a five year story, OP is now 24 years into publishing because the plot structure Oda created is practically infinitely expandable. However as you&rsquo;ll come to see, OP isn&rsquo;t perfect. Oda&rsquo;s greatest strength, his child like imagination, is also his greatest weakness. Oda is brimming with so many great ideas that he often struggles on what he wants to prioritize. With such a complex world and almost a thousand named characters, anytime Oda fleshes out an idea, it often comes at the cost of either forgetting about some of the main cast or else dramatically slowing down the pace of the plot. Despite the flaws, OP is incredibly fun and endearing. The action is exciting, the adventure is thrilling, the jokes are god-tier, the mysteries keep me awake at night and a surprising number of the emotional climaxes have made me cry. I can not think of any other story that has given me such a variety of emotions. I have been reading this manga for eight years now and I am still constantly surprised by it&rsquo;s consistent quality.<a href="#manga-is-generally-structured-a-lot-differently-from-books-because-it-s-serialized-weekly-dot-in-the-case-of-shounen-jump-manga-has-to-continuously-meet-popularity-standards-or-else-the-story-will-be-dropped-dot-this-means-many-long-running-manga-have-to-split-their-story-lines-into-digestible-arcs-to-attract-new-readers-and-to-keep-the-story-fresh-dot-it-also-leads-to-many-manga-using-popular-tropes-and-fan-service-to-keep-reader-s-weekly-interest-dot-this-has-led-to-several-manga-with-little-creative-freedom-authors-will-borrow-popular-character-and-story-archetypes-because-they-know-the-formula-is-safe-dot-many-manga-end-far-too-quickly-or-are-drawn-out-longer-than-needed-at-the-request-of-the-editors-dot-at-the-same-time-however-the-medium-of-comics-manga-give-authors-the-potential-for-kinds-of-creativity-that-doesn-t-exist-anywhere-else-dot-what-sets-one-piece-apart-is-that-oda-is-capable-of-utilizing-all-of-manga-s-creative-strengths-into-a-story-that-perfectly-fulfills-a-serialized-structure-dot-oda-s-world-is-built-for-adventure-as-the-straw-hat-s-must-face-new-challenges-as-they-progress-through-the-grand-line-one-island-at-a-time-dot-each-island-has-it-s-own-unique-environment-culture-and-enemy-so-the-story-doesn-t-feel-dry-dot-in-the-beginning-many-of-these-stories-seem-encapsulated-dot-however-as-you-progress-long-time-readers-are-rewarded-with-reoccurring-characters-and-payoffs-to-mysteries-set-up-several-hundred-chapters-before-dot-despite-the-complex-world-building-new-generations-of-readers-are-easily-enticed-by-oda-s-characters-themes-and-plot-lines-that-are-simple-to-understand-yet-powerfully-executed-dot-in-what-was-supposed-to-be-a-five-year-story-op-is-now-24-years-into-publishing-because-the-plot-structure-oda-created-is-practically-infinitely-expandable-dot-however-as-you-ll-come-to-see-op-isn-t-perfect-dot-oda-s-greatest-strength-his-child-like-imagination-is-also-his-greatest-weakness-dot-oda-is-brimming-with-so-many-great-ideas-that-he-often-struggles-on-what-he-wants-to-prioritize-dot-with-such-a-complex-world-and-almost-a-thousand-named-characters-anytime-oda-fleshes-out-an-idea-it-often-comes-at-the-cost-of-either-forgetting-about-some-of-the-main-cast-or-else-dramatically-slowing-down-the-pace-of-the-plot-dot-despite-the-flaws-op-is-incredibly-fun-and-endearing-dot-the-action-is-exciting-the-adventure-is-thrilling-the-jokes-are-god-tier-the-mysteries-keep-me-awake-at-night-and-a-surprising-number-of-the-emotional-climaxes-have-made-me-cry-dot-i-can-not-think-of-any-other-story-that-has-given-me-such-a-variety-of-emotions-dot-i-have-been-reading-this-manga-for-eight-years-now-and-i-am-still-constantly-surprised-by-it-s-consistent-quality-dot" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
